# Banner Image Implementation

The runner banner image has been implemented as the main hero section background on the homepage.

## Important Note

The image file needs to be manually added to the project at:
```
public/images/banners/runner-banner.jpg
```

A placeholder file has been created at this location, but you'll need to replace it with the actual image that was shared.

## Implementation Details

- The banner image is now used as the background for the hero section on the homepage
- The text has been updated to match the athletic theme of the image
- The image is loaded using Next.js's Image component for better optimization
- The "Shop Gear" button has been updated to "Shop Running Gear" to better match the image content

## How to View

1. Replace the placeholder file with the actual runner image
2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```
3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the updated banner
